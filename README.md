# Font

This is an app for creating fonts made in a distressingly short amount of time for a school project. The first version of this program, 'b8', dates back to early January of 2025, which was then canned for being written in C, which is too difficult to work with for an app as complex as this for me. The second version of this program, 'Calf', picks up where b8 left off, being a largely reprogrammed version of it in C++, dating back to early February. From there, more and more features were added, but the project became too disorganized, and a solid structure for the app logic was not well thought out. This is the third attempt, with an emphasis on quick and flexible code. The previous two versions used various other tools I've made (primarily mug, muCOSA, and muTrueType), but this one is coded from scratch due to those tools being fairly inefficient and buggy in my experience.

This is built to really only work with Windows, although it is internally structured so that it could theoretically be expanded into other operating systems in the future.
